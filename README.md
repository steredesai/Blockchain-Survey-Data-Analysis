# Data Analysis on Blockchain Technology (BCT Adoption)

## 1. Demographics
The study analyzed the demographics of the organizations and respondents involved in the research, which specifically focused on survey data related to the intention to adopt Blockchain Technology (BCT). Key findings include:

- Industries: Information Technology, Finance/Banking, Insurance, Education, and Manufacturing were the prominent industries.
- Respondents: 32.11% females, 64.22% males, with most falling in the age group of 41-50 years.
- Education: Postgraduate Degree or Higher was the highest qualification among respondents.

## 2. Measurement Model
The study evaluated the measurement model's reliability using Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability (CR), average variance extracted (AVE), discriminant validity, and cross-loadings. Findings include:

- Validity and reliability requirements were met.
- Cronbach's alpha values indicated good internal consistency.
- Constructs like Perceived Benefits, Perceived Volatility, Top Management Support, Government Support, etc., exhibited high reliability.

### 2.1 Reliability of Constructs
- Displays outer loading, lambda square, CR, AVE, and Cronbach's value for each construct.

### 2.2 Correlation of Constructs
- Summarizes the conclusions drawn from the correlation analysis of constructs.

### Key Conclusions:
1. Overall Model Fit: The model has a good fit with strong outer loadings and high composite reliability.
2. AVE Concerns: Some constructs exhibit relatively lower AVE values, suggesting areas for improvement.
3. Reliability: Composite reliability is generally high across constructs, indicating good internal consistency.
4. Top Performers: Constructs like Perceived Benefits, Top Management Support, Competition Intensity, etc., demonstrate strong reliability and high AVE.
5. Recommendations: Suggested exploration and refinement of constructs with lower AVE values for enhanced validity.

## 3. Hypothesis Testing
The study performed significance tests for path coefficients to understand how different factors influence the intention to adopt Blockchain Technology (BCT). Key findings include:

- Factors like Agility and Learning Capability (ALC), Ecosystem Sensitivity (ES), and Top Management Support (TMS) positively impact the intention to adopt.
- Factors like Competition Intensity (CI), Perceived Benefits (PB), and Perceived Risks (PR) do not show a significant impact.

### 3.1 Path Coefficient Analysis
- Presents the significance test results for path coefficients.

### Hypothesis Testing Results:
- Supported hypotheses include ALC -> INT, ES -> INT, and OI -> INT.
- Not supported hypotheses include CI -> INT, GS -> INT, PB -> INT, etc., as their respective t-values do not meet the significance criteria.
- H14i (PR x PIT -> INT) stands out with a significant t-value of 2.254, indicating a supported hypothesis.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into the factors influencing the intention to adopt Blockchain Technology (BCT), based on survey data. Researchers and practitioners can leverage these findings for a better understanding of the dynamics involved in technology adoption within organizations.
